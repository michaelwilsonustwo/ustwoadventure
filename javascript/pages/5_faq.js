        <p class="question">
            Why are you practicing two models of investment?
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
            Since 2014 we’ve been investing in companies. What we've seen in that
            time is that, like us, the most thoughtful and creative founders value
            their independence and care deeply about how they want to build their
            business.
        </p>
        
        <p class="answer">
            For some that means thoughfully approaching the VC industry in order to
            grow their business in a way that they want. For others this means owning
            their company and controlling it's future, but this often requires some
            capital to grow sustainably. Both of these are paths that we want to support,
            and are happy to be using mechanisms that can accomodate both.
        </p>


        <p class="question">
            Who is a fit?
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
            We look for tech-enabled businesses that are already generating
            revenue, have strong capabilities in both design and tech, and
            who's crosshair is aimed at their product and customers, not
            their next funding round.
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
            Mindset really matters to us. We are looking for founders who are
            genuine and value a long term approach over growth-at-all-costs.
            You see your business as an opportunity to express your values
            and you live by them.
        </p>


        <!-- <p class="question">
            Who isn't a fit?
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
            Businesses that have high R&D costs (e.g. deep tech), winner-takes-all
            industry dynamics (e.g. marketplaces, social networks) or typically
            lower margin business models (e.g. agencies) generally aren’t a
            good fit for our approach. This is because we want our investment
            to be the last round you need to raise while also having enough
            gross margin to manage the revenue share.
        </p> -->


        <p class="question">
            What does tech-enabled even mean any more?
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
            Good question! It feels like most new businesses are tech-enabled
            in some way these days. We use this phrase to mean businesses
            that are predominantly creating digital products and services.
            Think e-commerce, SaaS, digital content. This is by no means an
            exhaustive list. These are business models that benefit from
            decreasing costs of technology yet remain relatively scalable
            in nature.
        </p>


        <p class="question">
            Will ustwo deliver design and development work?
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
            The short answer is no. The better, longer answer is that we will
            be investing in companies that are independently strong in design
            thinking and execution, and so will provide support that we think
            is better suited for them. We’ll work with the creatives and
            experts within ustwo Studios for advisory and mentorship support.
            However, we won’t offer specific deliverables for our portfolio
            companies. Think of ustwo as an advisor to push your thinking,
            and not as a delivery partner.
        </p>


        <p class="question">
            How do you address inclusivity in your investment approach?
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
            We are committed to building a portfolio of companies that reflects
            the diversity of the world we live in. We believe this model of
            investment levels the playing field in two ways.
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
            Firstly, it acknowledges that niches can be valuable. We know
            from experience some ideas are overlooked because the investors
            making the decision can’t imagine a business reaching venture
            scale. This can exclude businesses focused on minority groups
            from consideration. We are not afraid of a niche.
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
            Secondly, we are looking for realistic targets. No need to promise
            the world to us. We’d rather see credible and thoughtful milestones.
            What we believe, and what we’ve seen so far, is that this invites a
            less entitled profile of founder. We’re excited to see how this
            plays out as we start investing with inclusion core to our thesis.
        </p>

        <!-- <p class="answer">
            We also ask all companies we meet to apply in exactly the same
            way, looking to reduce unfair network advantages.
        </p> -->


        <p class="question">
            How much do you invest?
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
            We expect our investment sizes to range from £25,000 to £100,000.
            As a result we tend to join rounds led by other investors.
        </p>


        <p class="question">
            What locations do you invest in?
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
            For our first year investing this way, we are focusing on the
            UK (where the Adventure team is based), but we’ll also consider
            investments in areas where we have an ustwo presence. Currently
            this list includes the US, Sweden, Portugal, and Australia.
        </p>


        <p class="question">
            Do you take a board seat?
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
            No. We want to be active, supportive partners, and we don’t need
            voting rights in your business to do that. It’s not about control,
            but trust.
        </p>


        <p class="question">
            How else do you help?
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
            Beyond the access to ustwobies, we have the Adventure community,
            which we’ve grown over the last four years through our existing
            investments and the co-working space we operated from 2017 to
            early 2019. This is a community of creatives, agencies, startups,
            and non-profits - all dedicated to helping one another navigate
            the many ups and downs of operating an early stage organisation.
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
            Last and not least, there is the Adventure team - Justin and Neef.
            We’ll take an active role in supporting you through regular meetings,
            to help you plan and unlock any connections we can to help you and
            your company.
        </p>
