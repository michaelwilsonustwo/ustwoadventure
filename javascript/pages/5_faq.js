            <p class="question">
                Have all of your investments been with this model?
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                Nope! Since 2014 we’ve invested in a handful of companies, all
                using various models. In that time the learnings we’ve made have
                led us to this one.
            </p>


            <p class="question">
                Are you currently making investments?
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                Not yet - we are still lining up our own investors, but we want to
                start investing as soon as possible. Watch this space, as they say.
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                That said, we are actively making connections with founders out there
                who are interested in this form of investment in the future or would
                like to learn more. If that’s you, feel free to drop us a line on

            <p class="question">
                Who isn't a fit?
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                Businesses that have high R&D costs (e.g., deep tech), winner-takes-all
                industry dynamics (e.g., marketplaces, social networks) or typically
                lower margin business models (e.g., agencies) generally aren’t a
                good fit for our approach. This is because we want our investment
                to be the last round you need to raise while also having enough
                gross margin to manage the revenue share.
            </p>


            <p class="question">
                Who is a fit?
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                We look for tech-enabled businesses that are already generating
                revenue, have strong capabilities in both design and tech, and
                are serious about becoming sustainably profitable.
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                Mindset really matters to us. We are looking for founders who
                value a long term approach over growth-at-all-costs. You see your
                business as an opportunity to express your values and you live
                by them. You would rather talk to customers than investors.
            </p>


            <p class="question">
                What does tech-enabled even mean any more?
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                Good question! It feels like most new businesses are tech enabled
                in some way these days. We use this phrase to mean businesses
                that are predominantly creating digital products and services.
                Think e-commerce, SaaS, digital content. This is by no means an
                exhaustive list! These are business models that benefit from
                decreasing costs of technology yet remain relatively scalable
                in nature.
            </p>


            <p class="question">
                Will ustwo deliver design and development work?
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                The short answer is no. The better, longer answer is that we will
                be investing in companies that are independently strong in design
                thinking and execution, and so will provide support that we think
                is better suited for them. We’ll work with the creatives and
                experts within ustwo Studios for advisory and mentorship support.
                However, we won’t offer specific deliverables for our portfolio
                companies. Think of ustwo as an advisor to push your thinking,
                and not as a delivery partner.
            </p>


            <p class="question">
                How do you address inclusivity in your investment approach?
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                We are committed building a portfolio of companies that reflects
                the diversity of the world we live in. We believe this model of
                investment levels the playing field in two ways.
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                Firstly, it acknowledges that niches can be valuable. We know
                from experience some ideas are overlooked because the investors
                making the decision can’t imagine a business reaching venture
                scale. This can exclude businesses focused on minority groups
                from consideration. We are not afraid of a niche.
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                Secondly, we are looking for realistic targets. No need to promise
                the world to us. We’d rather see credible and thoughtful milestones.
                What we believe, and what we’ve seen so far, is that this invites a
                less entitled profile of founder. We’re exciting to see how this
                plays out as we start investing with inclusion core to our thesis,
                as well as sharing this journey.
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                We also ask all companies we meet to apply in exactly the same
                way, looking to reduce unfair network advantages.
            </p>


            <p class="question">
                How much do you invest?
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                We expect to make investments up to £500,000, with the average
                being around £300,000.
            </p>


            <p class="question">
                What locations do you invest in?
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                In our first fund, we are focusing on the UK (where the Adventure
                team is based) but we’ll also consider investments in areas
                where we have an ustwo presence. Currently this list includes
                the US, Sweden, Portugal, and Australia.
            </p>


            <p class="question">
                Do you take a board seat?
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                No. We want to be active, supportive partners, and we don’t need
                voting rights in your business to do that. It’s not about control,
                but trust.
            </p>


            <p class="question">
                Do you co-invest?
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                We’d love to invest alongside others. So long as they’re willing
                to sign on to our terms, we’re happy to have the conversation.
            </p>


            <p class="question">
                How else do you help?
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                Beyond the access to ustwobies, we have the Adventure community,
                which we’ve grown over the last four years through our existing
                investments and the co-working space we operated from 2017 to
                early 2019. This is a community of creatives, agencies, startups,
                and non-profits - all dedicated to helping one another navigate
                the many ups and downs of operating an early stage organisation.
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                Last and not least, there is the Adventure team - Justin and Neef.
                We’ll take an active role in supporting you through regular meetings,
                to help you plan and unlock any connections we can to help you and
                your company.
            </p>
