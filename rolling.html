        Adventure fund - rolling updates
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        We’re raising a fund, it’s different.
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        It's something we’ve been thinking about doing since last July, after being asked to deeply reflect on our investment strategy past, present and future. We found this model - one which is about building profitable companies rather than unicorns - via Indie VC, and a few others since.
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        The model is one we feel is incredibly aligned to ustwo’s mission, and the UK in particular is perfect for this style of thinking and investing.
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        We are up against a lot of barriers - new structure, tiny fund, not traditional fund managers, just to name a few.
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        And so as one part chronicle and one part therapy, we’ve decided to keep a rolling log of the trials and triumphs of the process. Here we go!
      </p>

        Week 4 - <span class="date">07/01/19</span>
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Headline: It takes meetings to get meetings
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        When we really step back and look at who we know that likes to write cheques for £100k+, it turns out we need to meet more people. So we are reaching out to our network to make intros to their networks. The target is to ramp up to 10+ meetings a week about the fund.
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Biggest win: Talking to Founders
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        Parallel to meeting investors, we are equally excited about meeting founders who have heard about our plans and want to learn more. We had three great conversations with teams that - as you’d expect - are building the hard way. They want this kind of funding, but aren’t desperate. In the meantime, they are offering us terrific perspectives on what we’re building.
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Biggest challenge: Creating the long deck.
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        Conventional wisdom is you have a teaster deck, a longer pitch deck, and a follow up deck. We’ve got one out of three. It’s easy to put off building that longer pitch deck, so we have. But we've also started lining up some conversations that will make it necessary…!
      </p>

        Week 3 - <span class="date">17/12/18</span>
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Headline: Team takes a break after only 2 weeks
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        Two weeks on, two weeks off is not a recipe for success, so we’ll only do this once. That said, we did think it appropriate to reflect on 2018 and recharge for the big year ahead.
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Biggest win: More momentum
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        Indie VC launched its latest iteration on New Year’s Day. As leaders in this space, they have the platform to bring more and more attention to this approach to investing. A rising tide lifts all boats, as they say.
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Biggest challenge: Jet lag with a baby
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        One of us (and it’s not Neef) has a 10-month old. Baby’s first Christmas was spent five time zones from here. That makes for some fun sleep patterns during and after the holiday.

        Week 2 - <span class="date">10/12/18</span>
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Headline: First-time fundraisers told to ‘love the process’
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        When you tell the world you are raising a fund, you then have to start raising a fund if you want to be in any way credible. To make sure we avoid common pitfalls, we’ve been chatting with wiser folk than us. And four separate times, we heard ‘Love the process’. The subtext, of course, is that this can be a rather brutal thing to do, so decide now that you’re having fun!
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Biggest win: An outpouring of support!
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        Well, perhaps not an outpouring. But it felt great to have people we don’t know at all reach out to say they are excited by what we are doing. It’s really important for us to understand who is looking for this type of funding and what they think when they learn about it. As always, send interested people our way: justinm@ustwo.com.
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Biggest challenge: Tax...again :(
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        So that tax issue...not only do we not qualify for EIS...getting our return from revenue (instead of profit, or selling shares) gets taxed as income rather than capital gains. Who knew?! Our lawyer knew. And he has strongly suggested we use a profit share mechanism so that we lower the tax rate on our returns. This is ultimately more founder friendly, and thus potentially less investor friendly. It’s surmountable, but like so many other parts of this requires some explanation.

        Week 1 - <span class="date">03/12/18</span>
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Headline: Baby birds get pushed from the nest
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        After a long discussion on how we sequence the announcement of the ADV Fund, Mills immediately publishes a Medium post. Classic Mills. We quickly realised he was forcing us to get going. No more deck edits, no more copy edits. JFDI, as he would say.
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Biggest win: We started.
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        We 100% will not get this perfect, and so it was great to just get going and start learning.
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Biggest challenge: Tax!
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        This fund of ours does not fit the UK tax incentive scheme for private investors called EIS. This is because we are not taking equity upfront. Turns out HMRC wants to see shares change hands before it decides things are risky enough to justify offering tax breaks. We received some early questions about how we’ll handle this and other elements of the structure. I panicked for a night, and then felt better when our lawyer says he ‘has some ideas’...Fingers crossed.
